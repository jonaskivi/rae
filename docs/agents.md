# Agent Instructions

- Keep the Rae repo building (`make build`) and with tests passing before handing work back to Jonas.
- Commit and push to GitHub under the Jonas Kivi identity at regular, human-like intervals (roughly whenever a meaningful chunk of work is complete and the repo is green).
- Proactively remind Jonas when it’s a good time to make the next commit/push, and default to doing so whenever a typical engineer would (multiple times per day when active).
- Before each commit, run `./tools/stats/update_metrics.sh` to append up-to-date compiler file/line counts under `stats/`.
