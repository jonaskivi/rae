# Agent Instructions

- Keep the Rae repo building (`make build`) and with tests passing before handing work back to Jonas.
- Suggest committing and/or pushing when there is meaningful work and a good state to push, but do not push unless explicitly told.
- When asked to push, commit and push first, then continue with the next task without pushing at the end.
- Before each commit, run `./tools/stats/update_metrics.sh` to append up-to-date compiler file/line counts under `stats/`.
